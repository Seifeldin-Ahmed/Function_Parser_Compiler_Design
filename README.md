# Function_Parser_Compiler_Design


This project aims to implement a fully functional parser using c++ for a simple programming language. The parser consists of two main phases: lexical analysis (tokenization) and semantic analyzer (parsing). The lexer divides the input code into meaningful tokens and assigns them appropriate types. The parser then uses these tokens to construct a parse tree, which represents the hierarchical structure of the program. The output parse tree is visually represented in a suitable form, as described in lectures.
